# What is this?

This is Necto, the RLGym community bot. It's a bot that's learning to play 1's, 2's, and 3's thanks to RLGym.
Rocket League is a hard game though so we're all working together to give it the experience it needs.


# Can I play against it? 

Yup! Go download the [RLBot pack](https://rlbot.org/) and Necto is one of several bots that you can play against.
 Make sure fps is set to 120 and VSync is turned off.

# What Rocket League rank is Necto?

We estimate the RLBot version of Necto is high Diamond. 


# Can I watch it learn?

Yes! Check out our [Twitch stream here](https://www.twitch.tv/rlgym).

[Graphs are also available](https://wandb.ai/rolv-arild/rocket-learn) for our fellow nerds.



# Could it learn by playing against me?

We're working on it!


# Can donate my compute to help it learn faster?

If you're interested in offering your compute, first check our discord to see if we need more helpers. Then, make sure you have downloaded:
- Rocket League
- bakkesmod
- python >=3.8
- git

## To start computing

1. clone repo
2. start cmd as admin
3. create symlink to repo\training\training repo\training (mklink /D path\to\repo\training\training path\to\repo\training)
4. close cmd
6. open repo\training in windows explorer or non-admin cmd
7. Run runDistributedWorker.bat
8. enter your name + server ip + server password

when asked for the IP and password, dm Soren and he'll fill you in.
