# What is this?

This is Necto, the RLGym community bot. It's a bot that's learning to play 1's, 2's, and 3's thanks to RLGym.
Rocket League is a hard game though so we're all working together to give it the experience it needs.


# Can I watch it learn?

Yes! Check out our [Twitch stream here](https://www.twitch.tv/rlgym).

[Graphs are also available](https://wandb.ai/rolv-arild/rocket-learn) for our fellow nerds.

# Can I Help?

## To start computing

1. clone repo
2. start cmd as admin
3. create symlink to repo\training\training repo\training (mklink /D path\to\repo\training\training path\to\repo\training)
4. close cmd
6. open repo\training in windows explorer or non-admin cmd
7. Run runDistributedWorker.bat
8. enter your name + server ip + server password
